# 💧 $LIQUID — The First Liquid Pre-Tradable BRC 2.0 Token
### ✅ 100% FREE MINT ON BITCOIN ORDINALS

---

## 🚀 Overview

With the upcoming launch of **BRC2.0** on the Bitcoin mainnet (Block **909,969 ~ August 14**), the Bitcoin token landscape is about to evolve.

To celebrate this milestone, **$LIQUID** is launching as a **completely free and pre-tradable token** — a true throwback to the early **free mint** days of BRC-20.  
This is your opportunity to get in early, **mint for free**, and be part of the next chapter of Bitcoin tokenization.

## 🔥 What is $LIQUID?

**$LIQUID** is a **pre-BRC2.0** token that will become fully tradable on **Ordinals marketplaces**.  
It’s designed to be **immediately liquid**, **freely mintable**, and will be migrated to BRC2.0 through a **snapshot-based distribution** after launch.

- ✅ Tradable **before** BRC2.0 goes live  
- ✅ **Snapshot** of holders at BRC2.0 mainnet launch  
- ✅ No need to stake — just **hold to qualify**
- ✅ Once all 100,000 mints are completed, the inscriptions will be indexed and listed on Ordinals marketplaces like Magic Eden, making them tradable even before the official launch of BRC2.0.
